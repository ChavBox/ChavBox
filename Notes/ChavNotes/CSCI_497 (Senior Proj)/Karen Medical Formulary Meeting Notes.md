Involved in the Karen people living in territory bordering Thailand, helping medically.
Many little clinics where the government hasn't established anything so these people have no government resources to help with their health. 

Not fully fledged doctors, but have received a lot of training for how to tread a lot of health problems. 

Every doctor used to have a little booklet that has all the medicine allowed to be prescribed, gave dose, side affects, possible interactions.

Medics in Karen don't have access to any of this information, clinics in Burma needed information so the book got bigger.

Katie asked for an app that has the same information, paper booklet doesn't work for very rainy climate, mold, etc.

Last year, a second group took over android app and it was delivered.

Make available for Apple phones

Predominantly used by health workers with variable skill and training, but very dedicated to their cause.

Clear information makes health care better, gives correct dose to patients, notice side affects and understand why medicine might not be working.

### Changes To App

If you open the app, there are the basic sections, sections to add:
Malaria Treatment
- when looking for medicine it has link to go see malaria protocols
TB

When looking for drug, it has name and what it is, followed by table, under the table it has side effects, interactions, etc in dropdown menu

Karen font size is very small when toggled in translation - make bigger (modular?)
The more hyperlinks the better, if it interacts with another drug have that be a link
