# Software Requirments
## What to know
- what data is needed
- what security is needed for the data
- what fields are desired by the client?
- what are the security needs of the front end
	- what about the middle tier?

## Functional Requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Testing
- Volere says to start testing requirments as soon as you start coding them
- TTD - test driven development
**Software requirments need to be signed off by stakeholders**
# Stakeholders

# Agile Development
- Stakeholders and devs are to be co-located
- Document user Epics and Stories (requirments)
- Stakeholders o prioritize Epics and Stories for the dev team
- Documentation was intended to be minimal
- HIghly iterative - sprints - 2wks -> 6wks long
- **Particularly useful where requirements not 100% clear**
- Need metrics to show progress
- Define scrum: 10-15 min
- **Not sure Agile is appropriate for deployment of devices or other types of straight up deployment**
- Need budget and budgetary attention
