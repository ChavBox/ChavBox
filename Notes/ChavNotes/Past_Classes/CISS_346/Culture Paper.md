**How company response to cyber indecent impacts cyber security** 

I want to research various ways companies respond to cyber attacks, in their defense and how they adapt internally after the incident. How does the way they respond support or fail to support cyber security?  

- How do they deal with the fallout?
- What does their response look like internally?
- What actions do they take following an attack?
- What things should companies avoid doing after a cyber attack?
- What does an effective incident response look like?

**Title:** "Corporate Resilience in the Face of Cyber Attacks: Analyzing Response Strategies and Internal Adaptations"

**Research Questions:**

1. How do companies manage the immediate fallout of cyber attacks, and what impact does this have on their long-term cybersecurity posture?
2. What internal processes and cultural changes do organizations implement post-attack to enhance their resilience?
3. What specific actions are taken following a cyber attack to mitigate risks and restore operations?
4. What common pitfalls do companies encounter in their post-attack response, and how can these be avoided?
5. What characteristics define an effective incident response, and how do these practices contribute to overall cybersecurity improvements?
