# Marquis Argument (Abortion is Wrong)
He wants to avoid the question whether the fetus is a person, instead he asks us to consider why it is wrong to kill one of us. 
Why is death bad? Why is killing wrong?
- Because it is panful (often it is not)
- Because others will greive (sometimes they won't)
- Because we don't want to die (what if we don't care)
- Because killing us deprives us of our valuable futures (Marquis's favorite answer)
#### Future Like Ours
A little vague of an idea, but it refers to the sort of life that most human beings have, perhaps including the sorts of factors that Mary Anne Warren talks about

Argument Against:
1. Killing something with an FLO is seriously prima facie wrong.
2. The typical fetus has an FLO
3. So, it is seriously prima facie wrong to kill the fetus.

He allows four conditions under which abortion is permissible.
1. When the mother's life is at risk.
2. When the woman has been raped.
3. When the fetus is severely brain-damaged.
4. In the first two weeks after conception. 
Why think these exceptions are consistent with his theory...

Marquis believes that a fetus isn't considered a person until after 2 weeks of development because until about that point what is growing is just a cluster of cells that are dividing, and don't resemble something with human features yet. 

#### Prima Facie (ask about after class)

# Desire Argument
1. To wrong someone is to violate their interests.
2. If you have no desires, you have no interests.
3. So, if you have no desires, you cannot be wronged.
4. The fetus has no desires. 
So, the fetus cannot be wronged.
So, abortion is not wrong. 

# Agism Objection Argument
1. If Marquis is right, then it is worse to kill a young person than an old person.
2. But it is not worse to kill a young person than an old person.
So, Marquis is wrong. 


# Contraception Argument
1. If Marquis is correct, then contraception is wrong too.
	1. Thinking behind this: his theory is committed to be against contraception
2. But contraception is not wrong.
3. So, Marquis is not correct. 

#### Can a Sperm be a victim?
We have stayed the same person throughout our entire lives, we are the same person as we were when we were 5 years old, just born, and even a fetus in the womb.

The sperm isn't a part of this timeline because independently it does not become you, it is just one of the ingredients that come together to create you.

## Thomson style objection
Even if killing the fetus is wrong in the same way and for the same reason to kill you or me, the woman has the right to decide whether her body should be used to keep the fetus alive.
