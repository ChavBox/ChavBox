Part of the physics system

For a player to fall they need a rigid body

Anything that is a tangible object, we need a collider for it so that it can interact with other objects.

## Triggers
A type of collider that can trigger events, rather than a physical collision between two objects
- E.g. once you enter a trigger area the boss will spawn and music will start playing
- Can take action:
	- Upon entering the trigger
	- While inside the trigger
	- Upon leaving the trigger
