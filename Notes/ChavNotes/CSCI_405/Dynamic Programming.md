	Filling out a table of numbers - used in optimization problems
	Looking for a solution to
		-minimize cost
		-maximize value

### 4 Main Steps
1. Structure of optimal solution
2. Recursively define optimal value
3. Compute it bottom up or top down
4. Construct solution

##### Example: Rod Cutting
	Running a factory that produces steel rods, which are cut up. Different length cuts are valued differently.
	Input: length (n) of a rod and table of prices (P_i) for i = 1..n
