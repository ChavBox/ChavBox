q1. If the graph has no cycles then it cannot be inconsistent 
- augmented DFS
```
we have table of judegements
m edges (judgements)
n mushrooms
G(u, v)
(u,v).type = same/diff

mushroomDFS(G)
	init: visited = NIL
	while visited < G
		n = random mushroom not in visited
		mushroomVisit(G, n)


mushroomVisit(G, n):
	

```
