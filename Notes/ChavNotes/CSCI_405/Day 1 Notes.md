What makes a good algorithm?
- Efficiency - time and space
- It's consistent/deterministic
- Correctness
- Solves a useful problem
- Readability, clear implementation
- Versatile
- Ease/Simplicity
- Scale - parallel?

Is an efficient algorithm always good?

## Jevons Paradox

	engines getting more efficient - the use of engines increases alongside it

**Andy and Bill's Law**
	As computer chips become more efficient, more functionality is added to computers which is making them slow.
