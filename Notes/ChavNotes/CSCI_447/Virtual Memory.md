### Virtual Addresses
The address generated by a CPU is called a <u>logical</u> address, and most often referred to as  <u>virtual address</u>.

### MMU
	Memory Management Unit: responsible for ampping between a virtual address and physical one.

T/F: In order for a process to be executed, it must be "in" memory. | False
- Not all processes (PCB's) can fit into L1 cache, L2 cache, memory, etc at the same time

### Memory Protection
Cpu (logical address) ->  (< limit register) -> 
logical address + relocation register -> 
physical address in memory

Contiguous memory allocation is assumed here, but is not always used. 

### Contiguous Memory

### Segmentation
- Logical Address is made of two parts (tuple) \<segment num, offset> \<S, D>
- A segment table holds all of the segment IDs and their limits
- Segment number is an index into the segment table
- External fragmentation is when memory is fragmented in between segments, so there aren't large enough holes
	- One solution is to unfragment memory

### Paging
- Physical memory is broken into frames, or chunks. 
- The logical memory space is broken into blocks of the same size called pages.
- Each address generated has a p (offset/index) into a page table
- The base address at a specific index in the page table identifies the frame where the page is located in memory
- The d, or offset in combination with the frame, identifies where in a frame the exact requested address is located. 

##### Two important ramifications
- The logical address space is totally seperate from the physical address space the datda page can residue in any frame
- A process can have a high (32 bit for example) logical address space, even though less than $2^{32}$ bytes are available.
