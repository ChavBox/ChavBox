Comes from the phrase "a good death".
Active Euthanasia: doing something that ends the persons life, giving them a drink that will kill them, etc
Passive Euthanasia: doing something passive that allows the person to die, unplugging the ventilator, etc.

Voluntary euthanasia: patient wants to die and has made their wishes known.
Non-voluntary euthanasia: the patient is not capable of having/expressing a wish, but those close to them think that they would want to be dead to ease their suffering.

Is euthanasia wrong? Should it be illegal? 

### Argument for Euthanasia
Compassion, Respsect for Autonomy

Classical Utilitarianism
Preference Utilitarianism (Desire-Satisfaction Conseqentialism)
Kantianism:
- Respecting someones desires as long as they are rational and not harming others. 
Rights Theory:
- The most important idea is what rights do people and things have.
