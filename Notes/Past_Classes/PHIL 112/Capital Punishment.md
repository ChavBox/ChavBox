Thought: Capital Punishment (CP) is morally acceptable if and only if it reduces the number of murders that would be comitted (used as a deterrent)

__Does capital punishment prevent people from committing murder?__

A Priori Evidence (before empirical evidence, sitting and thinking about something):
- If you're trying to be convinced to not do something and the person convincing you is holding a gun to your head you are very likely to do what they are asking. (threat of death is a deterrent do do the thing)
- Gun example isn't a great comparison to capital punishment, because the death is very present and immediate, while with the death sentence it is not as immediate or in your face.

Empirical Evidence:
- USA: Has CP and a high number of murders per capita.
- UK: No CP and a low number of murders per capita.
- Correlation $\neq$  causation 
- US has more guns than people, while in the UK it is difficult to get a gun.
