Kant has views about what is good and the relationship between the good and what we ought to do.

Aught to do: wrong not to do it
### The Good Will
The only thing good in itself is the Good Will.
This is good, not because of it's results.
The Good Will is the will to do one's duty and to do it for the sake of duty.

#### Duty: what you ought to do.
Kant invokes what he calls <u>The Categorical Imperative</u>:
- Rules you have to follow regardless of your own desires. 
- Two versions:
	- __Universal Law Formulation__: Act only on that maxim that you can at the same time will to be a universal law.
	- __Humanity

### Universal Law Formulation
Act only on that maxim that you can at the same time will to be a universal law. 

An act is morally permissible iff it is performed in accordance with a maxim that the agent of the act can rationally will to become a universal law. 
- Maxim: A description of the reason and the context and your reasons for it.
- Rationally will: Would you like it, do you want it, are you willing to have it, are you rationally willing to have it. 
- Universal Law: A law that applies to everything regardless, similar to gravity. 

An act that is obligatory is something you aught to do

Actions in Kant's Views are either:
- Obligatory
- Optional
- Wrong

### Two different tests
Kant suggests that there are two different ways a person might be unable to will an act to be a universal law. 
1. Everyone doint it might involve a contradiction and so be an impossibility. His example is making a lying promise. 
2. Everyone doing it might be really bad for the person doing the act. Kant's example is refusing to help people in need. 
This leads to two different kinds of duties:
- Perfect Duties: A duty that you absolutely always have to follow
- Imperfect Duties: A duty that you more loosely follow, or obliged to fulfill in general but not in every instance. 

### Challenges to the Universal Law Formulation
1. If Kant's CI1 is true, then lying to the Nazis about hiding Jews Is Wrong.
2. But lying to the Nazis about hiding Jews is not wrong.
3. So, Kant's CI 1 is not true
