# Topic: Opinion Piece about what I think about policing speech on social media
	Persuasive Essay
Social Media Companies:
- Actively and intentionally police content on their sites, and
- Use endlessly scrolling feeds which are generate by algorithm
	- This is to maximize amount of time spend on site
	- A 2021 study found certain political views were amplified more than others from 2016-2020




# Question:
	Should social media be able to police speech on their platforms?
- In USA, we allow freedom of speech, but do not permit all speech e.g. (things that incite violence)
- Also address the roles of algorithms in social media sites
- What extra dangers do I see algorithms creating, or advantages they might offer compared to a newspaper editor.
- 3-5 pages, 12pt font, double-spaced
# Examples:

__Twitch vs Kick__
- Twitch has banned many streamers for violating their policy
- Kick live streaming arose aiming to have more lenient content policy
- There is a place for each kind of content, and the moderation helps keep websites on theme and appropriate for their intended audience.

- The Law:
	- Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.'
- Moderation is Useful:
	- Trade groups representing big tech companies told the court the laws violate their free speech rights to decide what content meets their policies — saying their forums should not be an open-ended portal for offensive or dangerous speech — including school bullying, harassment, terrorist ideology, racial hatred, medical misinformation and voter fraud.
- Argument For the Law:
	- Attorneys for the states told the court that social media companies lack free speech protection since they only "host" viewpoints, similar to the telecommunications industry — known as "common carriers" — which transmits speech with no editorial oversight.
	- After the arguments, Florida Gov. Ron De Santis — on Twitter/X no less — said, "We're gonna make sure we're doing everything we can to ensure people have a right to speak in these public forums. We want more speech, not less speech."

- Moderation Is Useful:
	- An association of technology companies called NetChoice sued, arguing that platforms have a right to moderate content on their sites — a practice that it said was crucial to keeping them attractive to users and advertisers.
	- 
- The Law: 
	- The Supreme Court heard arguments for nearly four hours on Monday on a pair of First Amendment cases challenging laws in Florida and Texas that seek to limit the ability of internet companies to moderate content on their platforms.
	- Florida and Texas enacted laws limiting the ability of large internet companies to curate what appears on their platforms, in part in response to what some conservatives considered censorship of right-wing views by Silicon Valley in the name of combating hate speech and misinformation.
- Argument for the Law:
	- Solicitors general for Florida and Texas defended their states’ laws and argued that big internet companies operating social media platforms that are essentially public forums should not be allowed to discriminate based on political views. They portrayed content moderation as censorship.
- Argument Against:
	- Paul Clement, a lawyer for NetChoice, argued that “censorship” was the wrong word when it is not the government acting and that the companies were instead exercising “editorial judgment.” He contended that it was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to compel the companies to publish views against their wills.
	- But Mr. Clement argued that they are like newspapers, citing a 1974 case that struck down a Florida law requiring papers to offer equal space to political candidates who wanted to respond to editorials or endorsements.
