Utilitarian value theory: the best consequences are those with the most utility, greatest amounts of happiness and lest suffering.

Consequentialsim is about which outcome of a scenario has the better consequences?

Consequentialism Objections:
1. Consequentialism justifies wrong actions Objection
	- If consequentialism is true, then we ought to do whatever will produce the best consequences
	- Sometimes doing whatever will produce the best consequences involves acting wrongly
	- If a moral theory tells us to act wrongly, it is false.
	- So, consequentialism is false.
-   Objection 2:
	- If consequentialism is true, then there is no moral difference between killing and letting die (when other things are equal)
	- But killing is worse than letting die
	- So, consequentialism is false
2. Consequentialism is too demanding.
	-  
3. Consequentialism requires us to know the future which is impossible.
