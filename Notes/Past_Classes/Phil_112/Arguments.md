[[Argument Forms]]
### Definitions
- Validity: An argument is valid if and only if it is not possible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.
- Sound Argument: An argument that is valid with all true premises.
### Two types of arguments
1. Deductive Argument
	- Succeeds when the premises support the conclusion
	- If it succeeds it is called valid
2. Inductive Argument
	- Succeeds when the premises make the conclusion more possible.
	- This "success" comes in degrees.
	- These types of arguments can be seen in medical research, polling, and other such fields. 


Argument Evaluation is determined by:
1. Are the Premises True?
2. Do the Premises support the conclusion?
