### Dedicated communication resources
- Resources are reserved for the entire duration of the communication
- E.G. phone call through PSTN uses circuit switching
### Network resources (bandwidth) are "sliced"
- Circuit uses
- FDM (Frequency division multiplexing)
	- Divides based on frequency
- TDM (Time division multiplexing)
	- Divides based on time

### Performance
- Circuit Setup time required
- Guaranteed performance
- No sharing
- Resource idle if not used: potential waste.
