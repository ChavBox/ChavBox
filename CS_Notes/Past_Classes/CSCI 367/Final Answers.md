__T/F__
1. A TCP segment has destination and source IP in it's header. __F__
2. Routers don't "have" network layers. __F__
3. TCP uses two-way handshake. __F__
4. In network protocol, IP attaches source and destination IP address and port number in header of datagram. __F__
5. In the eyes of intervening router, hosts in same subnet using NAT have different IP addresses. __F__
6. A forwarding table in router is derived by computation of routing algorithms that determine the shortest path from that router to other routers in same network. __T__
7. Congestion control protocol of TCP interpret triple dup, ACK and timeout as congestion. __T__
8. TCP increases data sending rate linearly. __F__
9. Link state algorithm faster than other one. __F__
10. TCP increases data sending rate by adjusting the congestion window. __T__
